Create a design with p5.js and get it running on github pages

The code should generate a custom (non-moving) shape inspired by the words “steep and fast”. For design inspiration - look at our reading materials: 

https://programmingdesignsystems.com/shape/basic-shapes/index.html

and then

https://programmingdesignsystems.com/shape/custom-shapes/index.html

This will involve writing code in vscode, and deploying to a host github pages using Git. Your submission should be a link to your running code.
